## 🔄 Development Workflow (CRITICAL)

### **IMPORTANT: Dual Environment Setup**

⚠️ **AI works in:** `/home/user/NNN-CRM` (server/remote environment)
⚠️ **User works in:** `/Users/zruss/Web Apps/NNN-CRM` (local Mac)

**This means:** After AI pushes changes, USER must pull them to see in dev server!

### **Core Rule: Feature Branch Workflow**

```
USER requests feature
  ↓
AI creates: claude/feature-name-<session-id>
  ↓
AI develops on branch, commits, pushes to GitHub
  ↓
**CRITICAL STEP:** USER pulls changes to their Mac
  │  $ git checkout claude/feature-name-<session-id>
  │  $ git pull origin claude/feature-name-<session-id>
  ↓
USER's dev server auto-reloads (2-3 seconds)
  ↓
USER tests the feature in browser
  ↓
Iterate: USER requests changes → AI updates same branch → USER pulls again
  ↓
USER approves: "Create a PR" or "merge it"
  ↓
AI creates PR (or USER does manually)
  ↓
USER reviews and merges to main (USER CONTROLS THIS)
  ↓
USER pulls main to their Mac
  │  $ git checkout main
  │  $ git pull origin main
  ↓
Dev server shows production code
```

### **Critical Constraints:**
1. ✅ **ALWAYS work on feature branches** named `claude/*`
2. ✅ **NEVER push directly to main** without user approval
3. ✅ **NEVER merge to main** without explicit user permission
4. ✅ **ALWAYS remind user to pull** after pushing changes
5. ✅ User controls production (main branch)
6. ✅ Create PR when user says "Create a PR" or "Looks good, merge it"

### **After Pushing Changes - AI Must Say:**

"✅ Changes pushed to GitHub! **On your Mac, run:**
```bash
git checkout claude/feature-name-<session-id>
git pull origin claude/feature-name-<session-id>
```
Your dev server should auto-reload in 2-3 seconds!"

## 🤖 AI Assistant Instructions

### When Starting a New Session

1. **Read this file first** to understand context
2. **Check current branch:** `git branch`
3. **Check git status:** `git status`
4. **Read ROADMAP.md** to understand priorities
5. **Never assume** - ask user for clarification if unclear

### When User Requests a Feature

```javascript
// Step 1: Create feature branch
const branchName = `claude/${featureName}`
git checkout -b ${branchName}

// Step 2: Plan the work
// - Create todo list with TodoWrite tool
// - Outline what you'll build
// - Get user confirmation if unclear

// Step 3: Develop
// - Make changes
// - Commit frequently with clear messages
// - Push to GitHub

// Step 4: Inform user
// Tell user:
// - Branch name
// - What was built
// - How to test: git checkout ${branchName}
// - Ask for feedback

// Step 5: Iterate or finalize
// - If changes needed: update same branch
// - If approved: create PR or merge (with permission)
```

### Code Quality Standards

**DO:**
- ✅ Add error handling (try-catch for localStorage, etc.)
- ✅ Validate inputs (no negative numbers, etc.)
- ✅ Write clear commit messages
- ✅ Use descriptive variable names
- ✅ Follow existing code style
- ✅ Test calculations thoroughly

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Push to main without approval
- ❌ Use `alert()` or `confirm()` (use modals instead)
- ❌ Add dependencies without asking
- ❌ Break existing functionality
- ❌ Skip error handling

## 🎯 Common Tasks

### "Help me set up the workflow" / "How do I get started?"

**Response:**

"I'll help you set up the development workflow. First, let's find your repository:

```bash
# On Mac/Linux
find ~ -name "NNN-CRM" -type d 2>/dev/null

# On Windows (PowerShell)
Get-ChildItem -Path $HOME -Filter "NNN-CRM" -Recurse -Directory -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Once you have the path, run:

```bash
cd "/path/to/NNN-CRM"  # Your path from above
npm install            # Install dependencies
npm start              # Start live environment
```

Browser opens to `localhost:3000` - you're ready!

See [GETTING-STARTED.md](../GETTING-STARTED.md) for detailed instructions."

---

### "I want to add [feature]"

```bash
# 1. Create branch
git checkout -b claude/add-${feature-name}

# 2. Use TodoWrite to plan
TodoWrite: [
  "Analyze requirements",
  "Design implementation",
  "Write code",
  "Test functionality",
  "Commit and push"
]

# 3. Implement

# 4. Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Add ${feature}: ${description}"

# 5. Push
git push -u origin claude/add-${feature-name}

# 6. Tell user
"✅ Feature complete!
Branch: claude/add-${feature-name}
To test: git checkout claude/add-${feature-name}
Changes: [list what was built]"
```

### "What should I work on next?"

```bash
# 1. Read ROADMAP.md
# 2. Recommend based on priorities:
#    - Priority 1: Critical refactoring (Iterations 3-6)
#    - Priority 2: Quality improvements (Iterations 7-10)
#    - Priority 3: New features (Feature Backlog)

# 3. Explain why it's important
```

### "Create a PR"

```bash
# If gh CLI available:
gh pr create --title "${title}" --body "${description}" --base main

# If not available:
# Tell user to create PR manually with provided:
# - Title
# - Description
# - Link to create PR
```

### "Merge it to main"

```bash
# ONLY with explicit user approval!

# Option 1: If on feature branch
git checkout main || echo "Note: main branch might have different name"
git merge ${feature-branch}
git push origin main

# Option 2: Via GitHub (preferred)
# Tell user: "I'll merge via GitHub" then use gh CLI or instruct manual merge
```

## 🚨 Critical Errors to Avoid

1. **Pushing to main without approval**
   - ALWAYS work on `claude/*` branches
   - NEVER `git push origin main` unless user explicitly approves

2. **Breaking the app**
   - Test before pushing
   - Don't remove existing functionality without permission
   - Add error handling

3. **Ignoring user control**
   - User decides when to merge
   - User decides what features to build
   - Ask for clarification if requirements unclear

4. **Poor git hygiene**
   - Don't leave branches half-finished
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Push regularly so user can test

---

## 🔄 Continuity Between Sessions

### What to Check
```bash
# 1. Current branch and status
git branch
git status

# 2. Recent activity
git log --oneline -5

# 3. Open branches
git branch -a | grep claude/

# 4. Any uncommitted work
git diff
```

### What to Ask User
- "Where did we leave off?"
- "What would you like to work on?"
- "Any branches ready to merge?"

---

## 📚 Learning the Codebase

### First-Time in Repo?
1. Read this file (AI-CONTEXT.md)
2. Skim README.md for project overview
3. Read ROADMAP.md for context on what's planned
4. Check git status and current branch
5. Ask user what they want to work on

### Understanding App.jsx
- Lines 1-100: Imports and state declarations
- Lines 100-500: Handler functions (CRUD operations)
- Lines 500-1000: Calculation functions
- Lines 1000-3285: JSX rendering (forms, cards, modals)

**Note:** This needs refactoring (see ROADMAP.md Iterations 3-6)

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### You're Doing Well If:
- ✅ User can test features locally with hot reload
- ✅ All changes are on feature branches

- ✅ Clear communication throughout

### Red Flags:
- ❌ Pushing to main without approval
- ❌ User can't test locally
- ❌ Breaking existing features
- ❌ Unclear what you're building
- ❌ No response to user feedback

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Can't push to branch"
- Check branch name starts with `claude/`
- Ensure you're not pushing to main

### "User wants to test but can't"
- Ensure you pushed to GitHub
- Provide branch name
- Give clear checkout instructions

### "Merge conflict"
- Pull latest from target branch
- Resolve conflicts
- Ask user for guidance if unclear

### "Feature request is vague"
- Ask clarifying questions
- Propose implementation approach
- Get user approval before proceeding

## 🎓 Example Session

```
NEW CLAUDE SESSION STARTS

1. Read AI-CONTEXT.md (this file)
2. Check: git status
3. See: On branch claude/some-feature

User: "What were we working on?"

You: [Check git log] "Looks like we were working on CSV export.
     The branch claude/add-csv-export has 3 commits.
     Would you like to continue with this, or start something new?"

User: "Let's add the broker names to that export"

You: [Switch to that branch if needed]
     [Make changes]
     [Commit and push]
     "✅ Updated CSV export to include broker names.
     To test: git pull origin claude/add-csv-export
     Your browser will hot-reload in 2-3 seconds."

User: "Perfect! Merge it to main"

You: [Create PR or merge with user approval]
     "✅ Merged to main! Feature is live."
```
